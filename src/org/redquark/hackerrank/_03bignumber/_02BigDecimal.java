/*
 * Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!
 *
 * Given an array, s, of n real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more!
 * Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that .1 is printed as .1,
 * and 0.1 is printed as 0.1. If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g.,.1 = 0.1 ),
 * then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
